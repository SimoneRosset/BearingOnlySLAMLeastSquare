This script is implemented in Octave, install it and run octave-cli.


The dataset is composed by a g2o file which contain poses and bearing observations. The file contain also odometry edges that are use to construct the initial guess for the problem.

Steps:
  - Parse the whole dataset and initialize the landmarks (Linear Triangulation) using two bearing observations coming from the most orthogonal poses wrt the relative landmark.
  - Setup a LS optimization that involves all the poses and landmarks initialized
  - In the bearing edges the ID of the relative landmark is reported, it is used to identify it for both the triangulation and the global optimization
         
Expected output :
  - Robot trajectory and Map


**With noise on measurements:**

Optimization minimizes the global error but still the optimization is subject to local minima due to intrinsic structure of the problem. Open this repo in a terminal and run:

```
octave-cli # to open octave

BearingOnlySLAMLeastSquare # in octave-cli

```

**Zero noise on measurements:**

Optimization starting from the ground truth with zero noise on measurements produces always zero error, this proves the correctness of the implementation. Open this repo in a terminal and run:

```
octave-cli 

test_no_noise

```
